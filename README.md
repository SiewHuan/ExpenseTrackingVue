# ExpenseTrackingVue
A SPA using Vue js on Expense Tracking

A basic expense tracker with
- a visualization of trend of expenses over time
- an ordered table of expenses

The visualization is created with Highcharts, plotted past 12 months of data. 
The table is created with a Sorted Table plugin that allows users to choose whichever attributes they want the list to be sorted in by clicking the column header.
